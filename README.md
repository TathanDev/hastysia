# Hastysia

Discover a modern haste server based on [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is in early beta! Bugs may occurs

## Features 

- Fast : Based on the super fast elysia framework, this haste server is very fast too (I hope)

- Modern : Use modern libraries to run so everything is updated !

- Configurable : Configure the server as you wish (well not for now but soon yes)


## Getting Started

Install Bun : [Installation](https://bun.com/docs/installation)

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TathanDev/haste-elysia.git
```

Install dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

Configure the server in the `config.ts`

Start the Server
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:7777/ with your browser to see the result.

## Upcoming features
Here a list of features I want to add to hastysia.

**More File storage**
Right now, Hastysia haste only support file storage.
But I want to add support for database supports

**Auto File Delete**
Add an option to delete old files

**Docker File**
I also want to add a docker file to easily deploy the service.

**Logger**
Some logs may be util

**A Better Name**
I think this name is good but can maybe change to something more profesionnal... I don't know for now
